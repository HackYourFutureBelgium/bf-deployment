# Deploying Vite React Project on Netlify

Netlify is a web hosting and automation platform which you can use to deploy your static sites. You will have to Sign up to Netlify if you donâ€™t have an account already and then you can create a new app from their menu.

## Deployment Manually

### 1. Prepare Your Vite React Project

- **Generate Production Build:**
  Use the following command to generate a production build of your Vite React project:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  This command will create a `dist` directory containing optimized and minified assets.

### 2. Create a Netlify Account

- **Sign Up for Netlify:**
  If you don't have a Netlify account, sign up at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### 3. Connect to GitHub

- **Connect GitHub Repository:**
  Connect your Vite React project repository to Netlify from the Netlify dashboard. This allows Netlify to automatically deploy your project whenever changes are pushed to the connected repository.

### 4. Configure Build Settings

- **Specify Build Command and Output Directory:**
  In the Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings" -> "Build & deploy" -> "Build settings." Set the build command to:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  And set the output directory to:

  ```bash
  dist
  ```

  This ensures that Netlify uses your Vite production build for deployment.

### 5. Environment Variables

- **Set Environment Variables:**
  If your Vite React project requires environment variables, set them in the Netlify dashboard under "Site settings" -> "Build & deploy" -> "Environment."

### 6. Deploy

- **Trigger Manual Deployment:**
  Manually trigger the deployment in the Netlify dashboard or push a change to your connected GitHub repository to automatically trigger a deployment.

- **View Deployment Logs:**
  Monitor the deployment process in the Netlify dashboard under "Deploys." View logs to identify any issues during the deployment.

### 7. Testing

- **Test Your Deployed Application:**
  Once the deployment is successful, test your Vite React application on the provided Netlify URL. Ensure all features work as expected.

## Deploy using Netlify CLI

### 1. **Install Netlify CLI:**

Ensure you have the Netlify CLI installed globally on your machine. If not, install it using the following npm command:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### 2. **Build Your Vite React Project:**

Generate a production build for your Vite React project. Use the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `dist` directory containing the optimized production build.

### 3. **Navigate to the Build Output Directory:**

Go to the root directory of your Vite React project, and navigate to the `dist` directory:

```bash
cd dist
```

### 4. **Initialize a New Git Repository (If not already done):**

If your project is not a Git repository, initialize one:

```bash
git init
```

### 5. **Login to Netlify:**

Run the following command to log in to your Netlify account:

```bash
ntl login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate and grant access to your Netlify account.

### 6. **Create a New Site on Netlify:**

Use the following command to create a new site on Netlify. This command will also link your local Git repository to the newly created Netlify site:

```bash
ntl init
```

Follow the prompts to set up the site. Choose the appropriate options, including the build command and directory.

### 7. **Deploy Your Site:**

Once the initialization is complete, deploy your site to Netlify:

```bash
ntl deploy
```

This command will prompt you to specify the directory to deploy. Enter the path to the `dist` directory.

### 8. **Configure Site Settings (Optional):**

You can configure site settings interactively or by modifying the `netlify.toml` file generated during the initialization. This includes specifying environment variables, redirects, and other settings.

### 9. **View Your Deployed Site:**

After the deployment is complete, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL where your Vite React project is hosted. Open this URL in a browser to view your deployed application.

### 10. **Testing:**

Thoroughly test your deployed Vite React application to ensure all features work as expected on the Netlify-hosted environment.
