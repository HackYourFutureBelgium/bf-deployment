# Deploying Node.js Express Project on Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy serverless functions, static sites, and more. This guide will walk you through deploying a Node.js Express project on Vercel.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Your Node.js Express Project:**

Ensure your Express project is set up and working locally.

### 2. **Initialize a Git Repository (If not already done):**

If your project is not a Git repository, initialize one:

```bash
git init
```

### 3. **Create a Vercel Account:**

If you don't have a Vercel account, sign up at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### 4. **Install Vercel CLI:**

Install the Vercel CLI globally on your machine:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### 5. **Login to Vercel:**

Run the following command to log in to your Vercel account:

```bash
vercel login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate and grant access to your Vercel account.

### 6. **Deploy Your Express Project:**

Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project for deployment. Choose the default settings for a static site when prompted.

### 7. **Configure Environment Variables:**

If your Express project relies on environment variables, configure them in the Vercel dashboard under "Settings" -> "Environment Variables."

### 8. **View Your Deployed Site:**

After the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL where your Node.js Express project is hosted. Open this URL in a browser to view your deployed application.

### 9. **Testing:**

Thoroughly test your deployed Node.js Express application to ensure all features work as expected on the Vercel-hosted environment.
