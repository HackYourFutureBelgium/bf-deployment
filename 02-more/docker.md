# Docker - Containerization Made Easy

## Overview

**Docker** is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers are isolated environments that package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Docker Components

Docker consists of the following main components:

- **Docker Daemon:** A background process that manages Docker containers on a system.
- **Docker Client:** A command-line tool that allows users to interact with the Docker daemon.
- **Docker Images:** Lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.
- **Docker Containers:** Runnable instances of a Docker image.

## Installation

Install Docker by following the instructions for your operating system:

- [Install Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install Docker on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Install Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

## Docker Basics

- **Docker Commands:**

  - `docker --version`: Check Docker version.
  - `docker info`: Display system-wide information.
  - `docker run`: Run a command in a new container.
  - `docker ps`: List running containers.
  - `docker images`: List available images.
  - `docker pull`: Pull an image from a registry.

- **Docker Help:**
  - Use `docker --help` or `docker COMMAND --help` for detailed information on Docker commands.

## Docker Images

- **Pulling Images:**

  ```bash
  docker pull image_name[:tag]
  ```

- **Building Images (with a Dockerfile):**

  ```bash
  docker build -t image_name[:tag] path/to/Dockerfile
  ```

- **Pushing Images to a Registry:**
  ```bash
  docker push image_name[:tag]
  ```

## Docker Containers

- **Running Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker run image_name[:tag]
  ```

- **Interactive Mode:**

  ```bash
  docker run -it image_name[:tag] /bin/bash
  ```

- **Detached Mode:**

  ```bash
  docker run -d image_name[:tag]
  ```

- **Stopping and Removing Containers:**

  ```bash
  docker stop container_id
  docker rm container_id
  ```

- **Viewing Container Logs:**
  ```bash
  docker logs container_id
  ```

## Docker Compose

- **Creating and Starting Services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- **Stopping Services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Defining Services in `docker-compose.yml`:**
  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    web:
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - '8080:80'
  ```

## Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a script used to create a Docker image. Example `Dockerfile` for a Node.js application:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose a port
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Networking

Docker provides various networking options for containers, such as bridge, host, overlay, and macvlan networks. Containers can communicate with each other using container names as hostnames.

## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of a container. They are often used to store database data, application state, or any data that should survive container restarts.

- **Creating a Volume:**

  ```bash
  docker volume create my_volume
  ```

- **Attaching a Volume to a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker run -v my_volume:/path/in/container image_name
  ```

## Docker Registry

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Popular public registries include Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, and Amazon ECR. You can also set up private registries.

- **Pushing Images to a Registry:**

  ```bash
  docker push registry_name/image_name[:tag]
  ```

- **Pulling Images from a Registry:**
  ```bash
  docker pull registry_name/image_name[:tag]
  ```

## Docker Security

- **Use Official Images:**
  Always prefer official images from trusted sources.

- **Regular Updates:**
  Keep your Docker software
